# Multisite Support

For projects with multiple sites, each site can store a different Address field value.

All native translation methods are supported:

### Proximity Searches

It's worth noting that [proximity searches](/proximity-search/) are generally confined to a single site (unless otherwise specified).

This gives you the flexibility of having differing addresses for different sites, or allowing an address to exist in one site, but not others.
